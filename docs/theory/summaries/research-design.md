# üìö Research Design

> üí° **Definition**  
> **Research design** is the **overall plan or framework** that guides a research study, specifying how data will be collected, measured > and analyzed in order to answer a specific research question or test a hypothesis.

## üìå Research Design Correlational 

> üí° **Definition**  
> Correlational designs are those that investigate the relationships between variables.

Example of research design correlational:

**H‚ÇÅ** : We hypothesize an association between ultra-processed food consumption and obesity among Brazilian females under 16.

A group of seven young students was assessed using two questionnaires‚Äîone regarding dietary habits and the other regarding BMI (Body Mass Index). The objective is to investigate whether a correlation exists between these two variables.

$$
\begin{array}{|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
\textbf{} & \textbf{Participants} & \textbf{Dietary habits} & \textbf{Weigth} \\
\hline
1 & P1 & ultra-processed food consumption & II \\
2 & P2 & ultra-processed food consumption & II \\
3 & P3 & ultra-processed food consumption & III \\
4 & P4 & processed food consumption & I \\
5 & P5 & natural food consumption & 0 \\
6 & P6 & ultra-processed food consumption & III \\
7 & P7 & processed food consumption & I \\
\hline
\end{array}

## üìå Research Design Experimental 

> üí° **Definition**  
> Experimental designs are those in which the researcher manipulates a variable called the independent variable (IV) to observe its effect on another variable, called the dependent variable (DV)..

Example of research design experimental:

**H‚ÇÅ** : We hypothesize an association between ultra-processed food consumption and obesity among Brazilian females under 16.

Two groups of girls aged between 12 and 16 years participated in a study. The first group was exposed to an ultra-processed diet for one month, while the second group followed a processed diet for the same period. The study aims to identify whether there is a relationship between BMI and type of diet in this study population.
