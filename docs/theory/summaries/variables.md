# 📚  Variables

Basically, in statistics, we have two types of variables: **observable** and **non-observable**.

A variable is something that can vary, i.e., it can take on different values or categories according to certain probability distributions.

We are interested in variables because we want to understand the reason for their variation and how they are related.

## Type of Variables

In statistics, variables are generally classified into **qualitative** and **quantitative**:
- **Qualitative variables** (also called categorical):
    - **Nominal**: categories without any inherent order, e.g., religion, race, gender.
    - **Ordinal**: categories with a natural order or ranking, e.g., education level, customer satisfaction (low/medium/high).

- **Quantitative variables** (also called numerical):
    - **Discrete**: take integer values, often representing counts, e.g., number of goals scored in a match.
    - **Continuous**: can take any value within an interval, e.g., weight, temperature, height.

## Category of Variables

**Independent variable (IV)**: the one that explains, influences, or is manipulated in a study. It usually represents the input.
- Example: number of study hours, dosage of a drug, room temperature.

**Dependent variable (DV)**: the one that responds, is affected by, or is measured in relation to the independent variable. It usually represents the output.

- Example: exam score (dependent on study hours), clinical improvement (dependent on drug dosage), plant growth (dependent on temperature).

📌 In short:

**Independent variable** → “the cause”
**Dependent variable** → “the effect”

**Confounding Variable**: a confounding variable is an extra variable that **is not the main focus of the study** but influences both the independent variable and the dependent variable
- **Issue**: it can create a **spurious association** (false or distorted) between the variables of interest, making it look like there is a causal relationship when, in fact, the effect is due to this third variable.
- **Example**:
    - Study: “Does ice cream consumption increase drowning cases?”
    - Possible confounding variable: temperature.
        - On hot days, people consume more ice cream (↑ consumption) and go swimming more often (↑ risk of drowning).
        - Thus, the association between ice cream and drowning is not causal, but explained by the confounding variable (temperature).
