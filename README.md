# Applied Stats Playground

This repository is my personal **playground for applied statistics**, where I explore statistical concepts, test ideas, and build proof-of-concept projects using **real-world datasets**.  
Depending on the experiment, I may use **C**, **R**, or **Python** — whichever language or tool best fits the task.

## 🎯 Goals
- Deepen my understanding of **descriptive and inferential statistics**
- Test statistical models and validate hypotheses with **real data**
- Compare implementations of statistical methods in different programming languages
- Create a reusable collection of code, notebooks, and datasets for future projects

## 📅 Study & Experimentation Schedule
🕐 **Time commitment:** Flexible, as needed for each experiment  
📆 **Duration:** Continuous — ongoing learning and project development  

## ✔️ Topics & Experiments
- Data collection and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Probability distributions
- Hypothesis testing
- Regression models (linear, logistic, etc.)
- ANOVA and other statistical tests
- Time series analysis
- Bayesian statistics
- Simulation and Monte Carlo methods
- Visualization techniques
